Using Machine Learning Models to Predict Presence of Diabetes

We explore the effectiveness and best predictors of several different binary classification models in predicting the presence of diabetes:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machines (Linear SVC)
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forests
5. AdaBoost

I created a '[model_tester](https://github.com/frvnkliu/diabetes-machine-learning/blob/696f21d14afda0603c8548becaf3c6be026ca24c/hw3.py#L47-L103)' python class in order to abstract away the implementatons and testing of each type of model.
